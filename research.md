  * A.  ***Godot*** <br>
        "Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface" <sup>1</sup>. Godot helps develolpers save time by giving them a variety of tools commonly used in game development. Their goal is to help users focus more on their game and less on redeveloping commonly used features. Godot is licensed under the MIT lecense and is completely free to use. Users of Godot are the sole owners of any games they create and Godot is supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy. 
  * B.  Godot was first worked on in 2007 by Juan 'reduz'Liniestsky and Ariel 'punto' Manzur. It was not until 2014 that Godot released its source code under the MIT License. The 'first commit'can be found [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/0e49da1687bc8192ed210947da52c9e5c5f301bb). There have since then been over 13,000 commits and there are currently over 3,000 issues and over 200 open pull requests. Godot is now on version 3.0 and 576 people have helped in making it what it is. At the time of writing, the most recent commit was on 3/24/2018.  
  * C.  Patches are submitted as a Pull Request and reviewed by other contributors. If no issues are raised or modifications requested, a maintaner of the repository will merge the commit with the master branch and close the pull request. 
  * ` D.  Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?. `
  * ' E.  Who has the highest amounts of "Unique Knowledge?" (As per your "Git-by-a-bus" report. If there is a tie, list each contributor, with links if possible). '
  * 'F  What is your project's "Calloway Coefficient of Fail?"'.
  * ***G  Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the same top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)***.
  * ***H  Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life) If not, what is the structure of its leadership, and how is it chosen?***.
  * ***I  Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?***.
  * ***J  What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?***.
  * ***K  How is the project's participation trending and why?***.
  * ***L  In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?***.
  * ***M  In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?***.
  * N.  Godot provides excellent documentation to help new users on-board to the project. In depth guides have been created to walk users through forking the project, checking out a branch and making changes, and then submitting a pull request to have their modifactions accepted into the upstream main branch. 
  * O.  Documentation also exists for the API to help users understand the proper usage. Tutorial code is given to the users to help them combine features of the Godot Engine. Users are provided with examples of a number of common implementaions. 
  * P.  If I ran into issues with this project, the first place that I would go to would be the IRC. There is a large active community always ready to answer any questions that may be had. 
  * ***Q  Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?***.
  * ***R  Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?***.
