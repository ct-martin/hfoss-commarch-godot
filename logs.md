## \<conncast>

did I do it? lol I'm in here right?

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: welcome :D

## \<conncast>

so if I log into riot with my phone, it should have this room saved, correct? it's charging now but that'd be more convenient for me so I don't miss messages

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: decentralized servers :D

## \<conncast>

Sweet got my mobile setup. Liking riot so far.

## \<refferee>

Hello! Sorry I missed class today, I ended up staying up till 7 working on homework. I meant to join via irc but thatbjust didn't happen

# Friday

## \<ctmartin>

Hey all, please make sure to use the GitHub repo.

( refferee , ycavirp768 , conncast ^ )

# Sunday

## \<ctmartin>

Hey refferee ycavirp768 conncast - the project is due tomorrow, do any of you want to commit to the repo?

## \<refferee>

I thought we had until Wednesday

That's my bad

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: Wednesday is also a presentation day so you're not completely wrong

## \<refferee>

I see, I'm sorry I didn't realize that. I'll do what I can tonight. I can try to start running git by a bus

Unless there's something else you think would be more useful.

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: that would be great. Also, dzho suggested gitbyalion for making the JSON more readable

## \<refferee>

Alright cool, I'll use that as well

## \<conncast>

Hey yeah I also thought we had till wednesday but I'm about to start doing some work on it. I've been having issues with git which I think I've fixed now

refferee: ctmartin would you two want me to work on making slides for the pres? I feel like the 'research' task would overlap with work done for git by abus and coef of fail but if not let me know

or looking at the wiki, on task 6 (https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/commarch) i could work on those questions

ritjoe/hfoss

 - GitHub

hfoss - Humanitarian/Free Open Source Software Development.

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: I forget offhand how I split them up... Just claim one of the parts left in the team proposal

## \<conncast>

yeah it's called but I guess thats the digging deeper portion

whoops. called "research"

## \<refferee>

I think working on the questions in section 6 would be a good

Research

Some of them can't be answered until I figure out how to get gbab working

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: you should be able to directly push to the repo instead of making a Prefferee: remember to add yourself to the teamproposal.md when you have a chance

## \<conncast>

ohh ok I thought maybe i could but idk i didnt wanna mess anything up haha

ive been trying to practice the workflow we set up for class because I kinda suck at it

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: as long as you don't try to go back in time I should be able to fix anything you break

## \<conncast>

hrm.. ok

no promises though

## \<ctmartin>

(aka, as long as you commit and don't try to undo commits I should be able to fix it)

## \<refferee>

Update, so far git by a bus is not my friend

## \<conncast>

ohh unfortunate. I've joined the Godot IRC to try and ask some em some questions about their repo management.

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: I've heard the same from others. Where are you at right now? I'm about to meet one of the other GBAB victims for food

## \<refferee>

I'm home, currently. I live just across the river from campus

Oh, maybe you meant where am i in the process of using gbab... In that, I've just been trying to run it. I install python 2, and I told the application where python 2 and git live on my machine

But every time I run it, it doesn't show any input files being taken in, and the output is empty. I also get errors from the get statistics file saying it was given to many arguments, which idk why that's happening

## \<conncast>

ctmartin: refferee for you two doing the calloway coef of fail or the git by a bus, does that give you insight into things like Benevolent Dictator for Life or turn over of "Core Team" ? Not sure if thats something I should determine from looking at commit activity or if one of the things you guys are doing will find them

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: GBAB might, coef doesn't

## \<conncast>

yeah I was thinking if either did it would be that one

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: I was told to tell you to run it on Linux (ex, saskia)

## \<refferee>

Alright, I'll do that

cxw7054 joined the room.

## \<refferee>

I got it to work, but it's just sort of stuck on the Godot file, probably due to size. I'll let it run until I go to bed, but have you heard of this never finishing?

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: stuck how so?

## \<refferee>

Stuck as in I ran it, and there is no output yet

Not really stuck, it's probably just running, I hope

## \<ctmartin>

...odd

## \<refferee>

I ran it on itself and it output in a few seconds. Godot is a bit larger

Idk, I'm gonna leave it for a bit I think

## \<ctmartin>

ok. ping me if it's being stuck before you go to bed

## \<refferee>

Sounds good

## \<cxw7054>

oh man i joined this irc way too late

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: A little. I think that last part left was prepping the info for presenting

conncast: how are you doing? Could you commit what you have so far?

## \<cxw7054>

did someone do #6 of the assignment

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: conncast is working on that

also pending on GBAB finishing (which refferee is working on)

## \<cxw7054>

conncast: are you working in that in a google doc?

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: found it at https://github.com/skimboarder/hfoss-commarch-godot/blob/research/research.md

going to merge it into my repo and then add coef of fail since you have push access to mine

## \<cxw7054>

lol ofc we're using github instead of a much easier google doc

ok i'll work on the rest of the questions

what are we going to use to present the slides

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: we can use google slides for that. for the blog post, make a blog.md or something. I can help with the blog part once refferee gets back and tells us if GBAB worked

conncast: if you're free could you also help with cleaning some of the answers into a blog format?

I need to toss in laundry, be back in a few

## \<conncast>

noo i didnt do it on a google doc its on my fork of the repo though

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: yeah, I found and merged it

also, added coef of fail in my copy

## \<conncast>

ok. ive got a few more things I wanna fill in about most contributing person

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: cool. just pull first to not conflict

also, rough opinion of the community (completely subjective, just curious)?

jwf was talking to the lead guy apparently about packaging it for fedora

## \<refferee>

No output yet on gbab. Gonna let it run until I finish the other work I'm doing then try again in a different Linux instance

I'll leave the original running though

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: ok. Going to poll dzho about that too. How long would you say it's been running for?

Also, you're running v2, correct?

## \<refferee>

No

Woops

I changed branches, I'm going to restart

## \<ctmartin>

That could do it

## \<refferee>

Let's hope. It's now running using the correct version of gbab

## \<conncast>

so im sorry I think I saw that someone asked for help with a blog version of these answers too. is that correct?

did we make a google doc for that?

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: don't care, but the final blog post should be in the repo. you have already done most of that by using full sentences, it's now mostly concatenating that

refferee: üëç

## \<conncast>

ahaha yeah no i don't care either. I'll put all this in a full doc when im done but i didnt wanna do that if someone else was already doin it

## \<cxw7054>

Do we have to make a blog

Can we not make a wiki in github?

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: we only need to make a post, not a whole blog. If you're going to use the wiki, just make a normal markdown file

## \<conncast>

I'd think that's fine right? just blog styled and give a link

## \<ctmartin>

Also, make sure all of you have put yourself in the team proposal

## \<refferee>

It's still running after 20 minutes, just to let y'all know where gbab stands

## \<cxw7054>

ok i just copy and pasted the readme.md into the wiki

is that fine?

do you want me to remove the readme.md after doing that?

and i guess i should put research.md as another page right?

## \<ctmartin>

No, just leave it

We only need one post

(the latter for research.md)

I need a shower, be back soonish. refferee - if it's nearing the 30min mark, drop by #rit-foss

## \<cxw7054>

oh yeah the research.md should be merged

with the readme right?

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: maybe once it's finished, but it's fine where it is. The blog post is just taking that and turning it into something more wordy

## \<cxw7054>

well actually i dont it has to

we can just have 3 pages on our wiki

## \<ctmartin>

No need, the blog post is just one

## \<cxw7054>

i can't edit my messages üò†

ok so merge everything for the wiki part?

## \<ctmartin>

For the blog post, your merging the information, but using actual writing rather than a mix of lists and short answer. conncast helped you out by using full sentences.

I'm going to be AFK for a bit here

Be back later

## \<cxw7054>

can't even react to ur messages either

this feels like slack 0.1

## \<ctmartin>

But this is FOSS. Outside of this class, sure, but in here it's best to just get used to it. Also, yes, Slack did start from IRC or at least a similar set of base features

You can use emojis to react üòâ

## \<cxw7054>

yeah and i asked him and he said we can use whatever as long as we can easily get the logs

logs count as showing ur work

i know it's easy to get logs from irc but i don't know about slack

## \<conncast>

so my answers should be fully merged

pull from upstream. if someone could proof read that'd be neat. imma do it myself here in a minute

oh whoops! I see I missed one. I'll fix that

## \<cxw7054>

we have too many branches

branches should be merged into master

and then deleted

i think someone to approve my pr's too

is research our "master" branch rn?

## \<conncast>

im just seeing one? mine has like 4 though lol il merge

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: you can also just push to mine, you have access...

## \<conncast>

ctmartin is the upstream. im forked from him

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: he forked from you

## \<cxw7054>

oh wait

think i was looking at skimboarder

## \<conncast>

ohh ok

one sec il fix mine

## \<cxw7054>

i'll close my pr and update the upstream then

## \<ctmartin>

I added remotes, just tell me which you want to merge and I'll do it

## \<conncast>

so mines updated with ctmartins too now, but idk how to get rid of these branches

## \<ctmartin>

Also, for future reference, if you have access to a repo (like mine; despite the fact it's mine) then you can just clone that directly without forking if you want to

conncast: big D or go to the repo settings

## \<conncast>

yeah i did repo settings. i cheat

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: lecense -> license

in A. in B there's a space missing after usernames

## \<conncast>

im afraid to know how many of those there are

## \<ctmartin>

(would edit myself, about to grab laundry though)

## \<conncast>

il drop it in a spell check before next commit. silly mistake

## \<ctmartin>

"GDSCript"

M>

refferee: how's GBAB going?

## \<conncast>

spell check fixes in. just need the GBAB answer. and any insight on the others I guess you get from it

## \<refferee>

Hey, I'm back, was away from my phone for a bit there. Gbab has not finished running

I'm going to open a different instance of Linux and try something different right now

## \<cxw7054>

how long should presentation be

and for the slides we can just summarize the stuff we wrote

or just i if u guys are gonna hit the hay soon

## \<conncast>

wait is pres due tomorrow or wed?

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: where did you find that mailing list from?

according to the schedule they start tomorrow, but also are on wednesday

## \<conncast>

i did not do that lol

i dont think

## \<cxw7054>

ctmartin: got the mailing list from the godot website

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: huh, I didn't see it when I looked... guess I need to change the coef of fail

## \<cxw7054>

ok i made a google slide and invited u guys

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: I started a run on saskia just to see and it's looking like it'll go about the same

I'm pretty much maxing out the CPIs

s/CPIs/CPUs

## \<conncast>

what kinda format are we looking for in this?

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: blog or slides?

## \<conncast>

slides, im sorry

## \<cxw7054>

don't we need both

## \<conncast>

lol yeah

so i guess both. and who wants to do what? cuz I can do either or both

## \<ctmartin>

conncast: why don't you do the blog post since you already wrote 80% of it

## \<cxw7054>

making the blog will just be copying and pasting into the wiki

## \<ctmartin>

wikis can't be PR-ed, use a blog.md file instead

## \<cxw7054>

what do u mean? you can edit it.

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: but you can't make a PR for it easily

## \<cxw7054>

do we need the pr functionality

## \<refferee>

@ctmartin I'm looking at using git by a truck but it wants to write to a file protected by the system,I'm not sure how to get around that unless I run on a Linux I own, which I do not have

## \<ctmartin>

I'd have to change some settings and then you'd have to clone a new repo

refferee: I'm trying to poke an overpower VM I have laying around into installing python2 right now

## \<cxw7054>

Write up a set of answers to these questions including how you arrived at your conclusions (links, convo quotes, irc logs, email threads, etc.) to be posted to your blogs individually.

## \<refferee>

Ok, well, gbat seems easy enough to use. I have a mint live boot I could try if you think that would be faster than your vm

I'll try getting that to run

## \<conncast>

ok. so it looks like we each right our own blog post and link to the research document

## \<refferee>

Just because I want to be able to contribute something to this project

## \<conncast>

the research document needs to be answers and sources to how we got them

## \<cxw7054>

ughh what does he mean by in ur own voice

the person who looked it up got the answer; end of story lol

## \<conncast>

lol

i used the github repo, the docs they provide, and their website for anyone interested

i hopped in their IRC and asked about logistic stuff but no on answered

there was conversations about other dev stuff though

## \<cxw7054>

oh they answered u for that stuff?

how did u get the git analysis?

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: that's the GBAB part

I'm throwing 8 vCPUs at GBAB now, going to see if I can get it to run just cause

## \<cxw7054>

i thought u didn't finish running it

like how did u get the commit history and top contributors

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: conncast probably looked at the repo stats then

## \<conncast>

yup

looked through contributors and such. for who did front end and backend i sorted by language and looked who was submitting what

Yesterday

## \<cxw7054>

this is where i got the mailing list actually

https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#communicating-with-developers

yeah it's used mostly to announce dev meetings in irc

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: I was able to run GBAB. Do you want to continue with GBAT and see what that gives?

## \<refferee>

If you have it, then no, I'd rather just leave it. I've had a big headache from trying to get gbat to work

What can I do to help at this point, as I couldn't get gbat or gbab to worm

Work

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: ok. don't worry about not being able to do GBAB, it was a raw processing power issue and I happen to have an 8-thread VM laying around

refferee: add yourself to the teamproposal and slides

## \<cxw7054>

refferee: slides are the only other thing we have left

## \<conncast>

and then personal blog posts, rightr?

and then personal blog posts, right?

## \<cxw7054>

slides don't have to be too long

## \<ctmartin>

yep

## \<cxw7054>

ughh that's gonna be annoying

is it due on the same day?

## \<ctmartin>

it looks like the blog might be due wednesday, but it's not clear enough that I'm going to take the chance

nvm, it looks like the blog is wednesday

can I leave the slides to you guys? I'm starting to really feel the need for sleep

## \<cxw7054>

yeah they're going to be based entirely on the research anyway

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: thanks. see you later today

## \<cxw7054>

if i can wake up then yeah

## \<refferee>

Did you put the output of gbab in the repo?

## \<cxw7054>

üòÖ

## \<ctmartin>

refferee: yep, there's a folder with the summary.json and git by a lion's charts

## \<refferee>

ctmartin: thanks!

## \<ctmartin>

refferee, conncast, cxw7054 : I'm going to brush my teeth and then head to bed. Speak now of forever (until 9:05) hold your peace if you want something

## \<conncast>

aha im all good

im in the same boat here in a second. gonna wake up and do some slide additions. ping me / email me cxw7054 if you need me to do anything

## \<refferee>

I think we're all fine, thanks for doing such a good job taking control of this all, you kept this afloat

## \<ctmartin>

btw, the GBAL chart for knowledge/author is a really quick and cheap way to do that slide ;)

## \<refferee>

I'll be working more on this through the night as i finish all the other work I have and this

## \<ctmartin>

+1 to you all then. I'll check again before I go to bed in a min, otherwise I'll see you at the usual time and place

## \<cxw7054>

üëç

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: just realized, could you set the slides to "anyone with the link can view" and then put the link in the repo? Thanks

## \<cxw7054>

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RPPt3ZGDr78KIGnCYvoEirhhCS2OJxyjYf2bJlgiiI4/edit?usp=sharing

## \<ctmartin>

With that, see you all in a few [hours]

## \<cxw7054>

oh in the repo

sure

should i put it in research

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: with that sharing seeing. Otherwise dzho will be unhappy when he goes to pull it up

cxw7054: in the team under the presentation section is good

*readme

Blame autocorrect for that

## \<cxw7054>

we dont have a presentation section in team proposal

## \<ctmartin>

No, readme.md

## \<cxw7054>

should we change readme.md btw?

ok whatever i added it

i am done with the slides

u guys can look over it

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: will do in a few

ctmartin|waiting (IRC) joined the room.

ctmartin|waiting (IRC)

cxw7054[m]: I changed the presentation permissions from "anyone at RIT can view" to "anyone with the link can view" since dzho isn't logged in

## \<cxw7054>

üï∫

where's my dancing parrot üòû

who wants to do what slides

## \<refferee>

History pls

ctmartin|waiting (IRC)

cxw7054[m]: i'll do coef and gbab

## \<cxw7054>

i'll do ease if contribution

who wants to do desription and comunity structure

## \<conncast>

I can do that

Are we going today?

## \<refferee>

We could.. do you guys want to?

## \<cxw7054>

yeah whatever

it's short anyway

## \<refferee>

ctmartin: conncast cxw7054 ?

ctmartin|waiting (IRC)

might as well get it over with

## \<conncast>

aha i guess yeah if everyone is down

ctmartin|waiting (IRC) left the room.

## \<conncast>

üëç

## \<refferee>

Good job all! Don't forget your personal blog posts and your email to dzho with your peer review

# Today

## \<cxw7054>

how do we get the logs from here?

## \<ctmartin>

cxw7054: when I get back to my computer I'll grab them
